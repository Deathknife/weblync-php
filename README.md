# weblync-php

So there's this https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298458

but you need to use his site & there's delay + ads

With this, you are running the backend yourself. It's instant redirect and no bullshit ads.

No panel like his but who cares. Edit Mysql in api/config.php and the commands + url is in there in the $links array.

Also run table.sql on your db, just needs to create a table.




In the weblync.sp just change `http://weblync.tokenstash.com/api/` to w/e you are hosting it
